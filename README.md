  Helping students all around the world manage their school life in a fun and easy way!
## Inspiration
  Our goal was to create a Discord bot that could help teachers and students manage their classwork. The goal was to provide a way for users to create classes, and to these classes add and view upcoming assignments and exams. 
## What it does
  This bot allows a user to create a class by providing a name, description, and the name of the class's teacher to the Discord bot. Users can add themselves to the class, and can view assignments and exams by simply providing a command in Discord.
## How we built it
  We used Discord.py to construct the bot. We worked together using Replit in order to collaborate virtually, and employed mySQL for database management. We divided tasks according to our respective areas of expertise, as well as by the amount of time we estimated that we would need for each section.
## Challenges we ran into
  The mySQL table was difficult to work with, in part due to the virtual nature of the project which constrained our ability to work together, and we were faced with a large volume of work to do in a fairly constrained timeframe. Despite these challenges, we were able to present a functional demo of the project, and in the end, finish the project. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
  We created a very user friendly bot that is highly stable, and fulfills our desired functionalities, in spite of the challenges that come with working virtually as opposed to in-person teamwork. We hope that this bot can be used to assist students and teachers in the real-world by providing a convenient way to manage busy academic schedules.
## What we learned
  We learned a lot about using Discord.py, teamwork skills, and the allotment of responsibilities. We became better at working despite not being able to meet in person, communicating our difficulties and suggestions, and setting common goals and objectives.
## What's next for StudyBuddy
  We will be interested in adding additional functionalities to StudyBuddy, such as keeping track of grades, pinpointing areas in which students can improve, and more! All of these things can be done by expanding upon the framework that we have created through this project.
